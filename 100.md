Querying Events by Tags Structure
---------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fernandolguevara` `requires:nip-12`

This NIP allows clients to query events from relays where a specific tag is present in the event's structure.

The filter condition matches if there is at least one tag name in common with the filter and event.

Example Subscription Filter
---------------------------

Below is an example filter that matches events with a `g` tag in their structure:

```json
{
  "tags": ["g"]
}
```

Suggested Use Cases

One of the suggested use cases for this NIP is for location-specific events. Clients can utilize the provided filter example to locate events with specific location-related tags, regardless of how the location information has been stored in the events.
